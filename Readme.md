# BlogHub

## Overview

This is a Blog App built using **React** as the frontend framework. The application features a **serverless backend** built with **Hono.js** and deployed on **Cloudflare**. **PostgreSQL** is used as the database, and **Prisma** serves as the ORM to manage database interactions. The entire project is developed in **TypeScript** for enhanced type safety and a better development experience. Input validation is handled using **Zod**, ensuring both frontend and backend inputs are validated consistently. Additionally, Zod type inference has been implemented by creating an npm package to streamline the validation process.
